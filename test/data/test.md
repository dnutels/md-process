# Universal Web Applications with React, Node and Express

**Web applications are everywhere.**

There is no official definition, but we've made the distinction: *web applications* are highly interactive, dynamic and performant, while *web sites* are informational and less transient. This **very rough** categorization provides us with a starting point, from which to apply development and design patterns.

```perl
#!/usr/local/bin/perl
print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
print "<html>\n";
print "<head><title>Perl - Hello, world!</title></head>\n";
print "<body>\n";
print "<h1>Hello, world!</h1>\n";
print "</body>\n";
print "</html>\n";
```
